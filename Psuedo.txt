Create a list with dicts for each user entry(want key:value pairs here since duplicates are not allowed)



************START HERE***************
 ---MAIN MENU---
    Switch case
        1: -Enter information in database
        2: -Return a User/Pass combination
        E: -Exit

If 1:
    Ask user to create a username (function)
        while username == something already in dict
            print "username already in use"
            break or continue?
        else
            enter username into dict
            call password length function

    Ask user to select a password length (function???)   
    ***Is password length necessary? Or should it assign to the username and the script specifies the length***                         
        while password length < =0
            print "password must be longer than x"
            call function again? or break
        else
            import a random password that equals user selected password length
            assign password to username just created
            prints username/password/timestamp combination 
If 2:
    What username is being looked for (function)
        found = false
            for x in len(list)
                if "username" in dictionary:
                    found = true (is a boolean needed??)
                    print "found"
                    return to main menu

If 3:
    if selection === e (function)
        sys.exit()
